This guide is built on my own experience. I created it to help less
experienced people (Here I am :) deploy applications on a real server.
Remember that even a different version of the same package might cause
errors.
Another thing worth mentioning is that I'm going to focus here on something
that caused issues in my deployment process, which have never shown on
localhost.
If you want to check the entire  repository, everything is available on my
GitHub
There are branches that You can easily go through and find more details that
were made compared to the localhost app.
Frontend branches:
````
<production> and  <version_2.0>
````
Backend  branches:
````
<main> and <deploy>
````

<h3> Everything that I wrote is in the MyDevil...pdf file.
<br>

I hope this help someone during the deployment process.

<br>
Both repositories which I used in this tutorial are available on my Github.


````
https://github.com/PatrykKeska/company_management_app_backend_nest
https://github.com/PatrykKeska/company_management_app_front
````
Everyone can go through the entire process and compare the localhost project and changes done for hosting.
